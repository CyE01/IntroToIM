# Midterm Project
## "Addition" by Chenyu due June 10
### The overall concept: 
- Creating a game with 8 bricks numbered from 1 to 8, 
players needs to move the blank brick (i.e. right, left, up, or down), one at a time until they can not move any more bricks.
- Calculate the final result by adding all the numbers together:
the smaller the number is, the better the perfromance is.
### Instructions for usage:
- Players can move the bricks up, down, left, and right with the the associated key on their keyboard.
- Players won't be able to know which brick can not be moved until they encounter the problem.
- The bricks that can not be moved changes each time. 
### Inspirations:
- Simple Puzzle game <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1yHUCq8JyE&t=288s>
- Puzzle game tutorial in Java <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZFmEG-dq-c&t=23s>
- SoundFile: "https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/SoundFile.html"
### Major problems:
- I wasn't sure or able to control which bricks to stay put, that is why it varies every time.
- It was difficult to move the bricks and shift the positions between two bricks, until I saw the tutorials.
- I tried to move and select, but I failed.
