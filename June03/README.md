# Assignment 3
## "Raindrops" (Inspired by <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkyIDI6rQJI" >PurpleRain</a></li> 
- Here is a video of my work:
- Here is the screenshots of my work:
### Description (use Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Array to create a rain):
- Draw a raindrop with ellipse and triangle. 
- Using "PShape" and "createShape" to create the raindrop group. 
- Using "class" to create a unit of raindrop falling down from the top.
- Using array to duplicate the unit and create 85 raindrops falling down from radom coordinates at a random rate. 
### Difficulities:
- At first, I did not know how to make a custom shape nor how to merge two shapes in one group. 
But after searching on reference page, I was able to learn how to use "PShape" and "createShape".
- After creating the raindrop shape and wrote the "class", 
I can't make the single raindrop move (i.e. or move as a whole) for some reason that I still don't understand. 
But I found a video that help me solve the problem in another method.
