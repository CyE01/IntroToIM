### Description:
- Goal: use Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Array to create a rain.
- Insprised by: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkyIDI6rQJI" >PurpleRain</a>
- Process:
  - Draw a raindrop with ellipse and triangle. 
  - Using "PShape" and "createShape" to create the raindrop group. 
  - Using "class" to create a unit of raindrop falling down from the top.
  - Using array to duplicate the unit and create 85 raindrops falling down from radom coordinates at a random rate. 
### Difficulties:
- At first, I did not know how to make a customed shape nor how to merge two shapes in one group. 
But after searching on reference page, I learned how to use "PShape" and "createShape".
- After creating the raindrop shape and finished coding the "class", 
I was not able to move the single raindrop (i.e. or move as a whole) for some reason that I still don't quite understand. 
But I found a video that help me solve the problem with another method (please refer to the video link above).
