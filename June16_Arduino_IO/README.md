# Assignment 
## IDE Production
### Introduction:\

In this assignment, I used one analog input and digital input (switch) and two outputs (lightbulb) to stimulate an envrionment
when the analog input is turned on, the yellow light lights on, otherwise the green light lights on, 
and when the digital input is turned on, both the yellow and the green light light on. 

This system can be used in Escape rooms. When green light is on, it signals that the players can go for the next step.
If the yellow light is on, then the players need to figure out another way. 
If both lights are on, then the players can go to the next room.
