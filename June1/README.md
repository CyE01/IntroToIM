- Major Diffiiculties
  - It was hard to determine the exact location to put my shapes. I had to try multiple times before finding the correct coordinates. I had difficulties to color an area that is a within the shape. For example, my hair is drawn with two lines on my face. I wanted to make my hair black, but it was hard to fill the area outlined by my upper face and the two lines.
