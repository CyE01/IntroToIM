## Data Visualization:
Here is the video of my work:

Here are a few screenshots:

### Description (Avocados):
- Goal: Create a graph about Avocado prices to demonstrate its relationship with the total volume. 
- Coding Process:
  - 1) Create an instroduction page with "PFont" "text" "loadImage", "String", and use "keyPressed" to control the flow from the introduction page to the main page
  - 2) Creating a class as the main page (i.e. Coordinate system and data points) with "lines", "table", "loadTable", "TableRow" "getFloat", and "ellipse", and use the same method to label x and y axis. 
- Instructions for usage: Pressed any key to jump from the introduction page to the main page and the graph will automatically show up. 
- The source of data: <kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices>.

### Difficulties and Challenages:
- 1) When I first created the introduction page and the main page without "keyPressed" function, the introduction page only retain around 1 sec before juming to the main page. I tried to use delay but it did not work, so I decided to try "keyPressed".
- 2) It was little bit confusing to organize such a huge amount of data that fits the proper size, so I decided to cut down the number of data to 1000 and manipulated the unit of my x and y values. 
- 3) I did not know that I could use table instead of string at the very beginning, and I spent a lot of time trying to separate the array with commas.
